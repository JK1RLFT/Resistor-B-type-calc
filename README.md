This is used to calculate the resistance value of a B-type resistor employed in railway track circuits.

Type B Resistor Calculator
This tool calculates the equivalent resistance of a B-type resistor network.

How to use:

Click terminals to select input (IN) and output (OUT).
Add jumpers if needed (up to 3).
The equivalent resistance will be displayed automatically.
